- Implement regular VC kernel
- Implement VC kernel with exponential decay variant: use generating function
- Create binary for sending jobs to cluster 
- Implement option to load directly all kernel parameters and store them easily in the kernel class: read and write 
- Build exponential kernel with hamming distance: shoudl correspond to exponential decay
- Create test for GPU kernel: calculations seem different from the ones on cpu
