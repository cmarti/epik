Docs
- Include numerical issues in the tutorial: check convergence, rank orderings of the marginal likelihoods and diagnose the MLL calculation. 
- Write somewhere in the documentation that all kernels expect one-hot encoded sequences.

Old
- Implement option to load directly all kernel parameters and store them easily in the kernel class: read and write 
- implemente method to take all hyperparameters from the set of kernels in Epik (even in the presence of ScaleKernel or constant module)
- Add method to priors that take the kernel as argument and return the transformed parameters automatically
  this would allow abstraction of internal names within the priors
- Implement option to load directly all kernel parameters and store them easily in the kernel class: read and write
- Review partitioning during prediction. We seem to be having memory problem after fitting.
  v1.08 seems to have some problems not building the whole matrix for prediction 
  and new version 1.11 does support partitioning in multiple GPUs anymore
- We can also try to empty memory after having maximized the marginal likelihood just in case -> doesn't work
- Study more pytorch memory usage 
- Move to KeOps Kernels for partitioning in gpytorch 1.11 on single GPUs
